     3. When a release is ready, a release branch is created for final testing.
     4. The release branch is merged into both `master` and `develop`.
     5. Hotfix branches are used to fix production issues directly on `master`.

2. **GitHub Flow:**
   - **Description:** GitHub Flow is a simpler and more continuous workflow designed for frequent releases.
   - **Key Branches:**
     - **`main`:** Represents the main branch (or other designated primary branch).
     - **Feature branches:** Created for each new feature or bug fix.
   - **Workflow:**
     1. Create a branch for a new feature or bug fix.
     2. Make changes and push the branch.
     3. Open a pull request (PR) to initiate code review and discussion.
     4. Merge the PR into the `main` branch after approval.
     5. Deploy the changes to production.

3. **GitLab Flow:**
   - **Description:** GitLab Flow is similar to GitHub Flow but introduces the concept of environments for different stages of the development pipeline.
   - **Key Branches:**
     - **`main`:** Represents the main branch.
